# EyeScary CDN
A repo containing the stuff (well, fonts atm) we use, plus some other stuff incase anyone else wants to use this.  

## How to use
Despite the gh pages deployments, if you are from outside the organisation please use jsDelivr or Statically to serve the assets, like this:  

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/EyeScary-Development/CDN/fonts/croscore/css/carlito.css")
```  
or  
```css
@import url("https://cdn.statically.io/gh/EyeScary-Development/CDN/main/fonts/croscore/css/carlito.css")
```
